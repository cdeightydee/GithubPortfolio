        <p>“Ragtime” was born in the African-American communities of St. Louis in the 1890’s. This style takes traditional march form, much like the music of John Philip Sousa, and adds the syncopated, or “ragged”, rhythms of African music. ("Ragtime". Wikipedia.) Ragtime was very popular dance music, that later evolved into Jazz.</p>
        <p>Black dances (dances inspired by African style dance moves) became wildly popular with the general public. Some moves were the shimmy, turkey trot, buzzard lope, chicken scratch, monkey glide, and the bunny hug. The white audiences first saw the dances preformed at vaudeville shows, and later they were preformed by exhibition dancers at the clubs. ("1920's Music". 1920/30.com.)</p>
