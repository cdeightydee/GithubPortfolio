    <p>“Ragtime” was born in the African-American communities of St. Louis in the 1890’s. This style takes traditional
      march form, much like the music of John Philip Sousa, and adds the syncopated, or “ragged”, rhythms of African
      music. ("Ragtime". Wikipedia.) Ragtime was very popular dance music, that later evolved into Jazz.</p>
    <p>Black dances (dances inspired by African style dance moves) became wildly popular with the general public. Some
      moves were the shimmy, turkey trot, buzzard lope, chicken scratch, monkey glide, and the bunny hug. The white
      audiences first saw the dances preformed at vaudeville shows, and later they were preformed by exhibition dancers
      at the clubs. ("1920's Music". 1920/30.com.)</p>

    <p>Jazz music began in the early 1900's. it was originated from blues and ragtime music that was popular in the late
      1800's. The genre is mainly performed by African Americans. The Dixieland Jass Band becomes the first to record
      jazz music.</p>
    <p>Jazz spread to dance halls, speakeasies, manifested in marching bands, and was popular on the radio. Some popular
      jazz artists were Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Jelly Roll Morton, and Red Hot Poppers. ("1920's Music".

      to $3.50 a seat. ("1920's Music". 1920/30.com.) Before the creation of talking films, musicals were originated in
      the theatrical Broadway area of New York City.</p>
    <p>George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin were very successful composers and a lot of their work

    <p>Swing gained popularity around 1935 and begun "the Swing Era" which lasted about 10 years. Benny Goodman's big
      band played at the Palomar in Los Angeles. This would be known as the "unofficial" start of the Swing Era. (Shared
      Google Document.)</p>
    <p>Swing music is a sub genre of jazz, but its easier to dance to swing which is why it gained so much popularity.
      Because of WWII swing musics popularity took a decline, as it was hard to have such large bands in venues.

      <p>Traditional Pop refers to post-big band and pre-rock & roll pop music. Traditional pop drew from a repertoire
        of songs written by professional songwriters and were performed by a vocalist that was supported by either an
        orchestra or a small band.
        In traditional pop, the song is the key -- although the singer is the focal point, this style of singing doesn't
        rely on vocal improvisations like jazz singing does.</p>
      <p>Traditional pop can also refer to the orchestra leaders and arrangers that provided the instrumental settings
        for vocalists. Frank Sinatra was one of the most popular pop artists of the 20th century, having sold over 150
        million records worldwide. The phenomenon became officially known as "Sinatramania" after his "legendary
        opening" at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942.</p>

        In the 50’s, R&B was led by vocalists like Ray Charles and Ruth Brown, and by vocal groups like the Drifters and
