          <p>Tux is a penguin character and the official brand character of the Linux kernel.[1] Originally created as
            an entry to a Linux logo competition, To read a more in depth look at Tux (linux) check out his <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia Page</a></p>
          <p>Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various
            styles. The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux.</p>
          <p>The concept of the Linux brand character being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.
          </p>
          <p>According to Jeff Ayers, Linus Torvalds had a "fixation for flightless, fat waterfowl" and Torvalds claims
            to have contracted "penguinitis" after being nibbled by a little penguin on a visit to the National Zoo &
            Aquarium in Canberra, Australia, joking that the disease "makes you stay awake at nights just thinking about
            penguins and feeling great love towards them."</p>
          <p>Tux has taken on a role in the Linux community similar to that which Mario holds in the Nintendo
            community.[23] The character has been featured in open-source look-alikes of other mainstream games, such as
            Tux Racer, Extreme Tux Racer, SuperTux, SuperTuxKart, and Tux Paint</p>
